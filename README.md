# Addilo

Addilo is a Machine Learning and Data Analysis library designed for both those trying to understand the basics of machine learning by testing out different networks and those who desire a flexible neural networking creation system for comparative studies. The original version of Addilo was implemented in R, but an F# version is currently being developed, and incomplete code is available here but not yet fully documented.

This repository includes the source code `source-R -> code` and sample code `example-code-R` with the relavent datasets `example-data`.

See [addilo.net](https://addilo.net) for specific details, and more thorough explanations of the examples.
